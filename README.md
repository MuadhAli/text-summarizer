# Text Summarizer App

This is a simple text summarizer app built using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model and Streamlit. The app allows users to input any text and generate a summarized version of that text.

## Features

- Input any text and generate a summarized version of that text
- Specify the length of the summary in terms of number of sentences

- Copy the summarized text to the clipboard for easy sharing or further analysis

## How it Works

The app uses the GPT-3 language model from OpenAI to generate the summarized text. When a user inputs some text, the app sends that text to the GPT-3 model and requests a summary of the text. The model generates the summary based on the input text and returns it to the app, which then displays it to the user.
